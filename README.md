## Projects Overview

### 1. üé® Generative p5.js Art (Aug 2024)

The **"Generative p5.js Art (Aug 2024)"** project explores a 
glitch-inspired aesthetic by using noise functions to create distortions 
and randomness. It follows a structured grid pattern where each shape is 
slightly perturbed, resulting in an abstract, glitchy visual.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Distortion and Noise Control**: Noise-based subtle variations to add 
distortion while maintaining artistic cohesion.
  - **Randomized Geometric Elements**: Shapes and colors are selected 
randomly, ensuring that each artwork is unique.
  - **Generative Techniques**: Use of algorithmic rules to create visually 
cohesive art despite randomness.

### 2. üé® Generative p5.js Art (Oct 2024)

The **"Generative p5.js Art (Oct 2024)"** project generates an abstract 
smiley face, focusing on the concept of geometric symmetry. The face is 
constructed by quadrant-based mirroring, resulting in a balanced and 
cohesive visual, with emphasis on recognizable facial elements like eyes.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Quadrant-Based Symmetry**: The canvas is divided into four 
quadrants, with shapes mirrored across each, creating a balanced visual 
representation.
  - **Abstracted Facial Features**: Features such as the eyes are 
represented abstractly using ellipses and rectangles to convey emotion in 
an unconventional style.
  - **Random Element Generation**: While the smiley motif remains 
consistent, the surrounding patterns are randomized, making each version 
unique.

### 3. ‚úíÔ∏èüé® Stippling Image Conversion

The **"Stippling Image Conversion"** project is designed to convert any 
PNG or JPG image into an intricate SVG format using stippling techniques. 
It analyzes the grayscale intensity of an input image and creates a 
stippled effect that mimics traditional pointillism.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Grayscale Image Processing**: Converts the input image to grayscale, 
which is then used to generate dot placement and density.
  - **Dot Density Control**: The density of stipples corresponds to the 
darkness of the image region, resulting in highly detailed visual 
representations.
  - **Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) Output**: Outputs a scalable SVG file 
that can be used for further artistic applications or high-resolution 
prints.
