## Welcome to My Generative Art Journey

Hello! I am just beginning my journey into the world of generative art using p5.js and Python. I am excited to explore new techniques and share my progress with fellow artists and designers. This repository hosts my projects and experiments.

## Projects Overview

### Generative p5.js Art (August 2024)

The "Generative p5.js Art (August 2024)" project explores a glitch-inspired aesthetic by using noise functions to create distortions and randomness. It follows a structured grid pattern where each element is uniquely generated.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Distortion and Noise Control**: Noise-based subtle variations to add distortion while maintaining artistic cohesion.
  - **Randomized Geometric Elements**: Shapes and colors are selected randomly, ensuring that each artwork is unique.
  - **Generative Techniques**: Use of algorithmic rules to create visually cohesive art despite randomness.

_(Full code is available in `Generative_p5js_Art_Aug_2024.js`)_

### Generative p5.js Art (October 2024)

The "Generative p5.js Art (October 2024)" project generates an abstract smiley face, focusing on the concept of geometric symmetry. The face is constructed by quadrant-based mirroring, resulting in a visually balanced artwork.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Quadrant-Based Symmetry**: The canvas is divided into four quadrants, with shapes mirrored across each, creating a balanced visual representation.
  - **Abstracted Facial Features**: Features such as the eyes are represented abstractly using ellipses and rectangles to convey emotion in an unconventional style.
  - **Random Element Generation**: While the smiley motif remains consistent, the surrounding patterns are randomized, making each version unique.

### Stippling Image Conversion

The "Stippling Image Conversion" project is designed to convert any PNG or JPG image into an intricate SVG format using stippling techniques. It analyzes the grayscale intensity of an input image to determine dot placement and density.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Grayscale Image Processing**: Converts the input image to grayscale, which is then used to generate dot placement and density.
  - **Dot Density Control**: The density of stipples corresponds to the darkness of the image region, resulting in highly detailed visual representations.
  - **Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) Output**: Outputs a scalable SVG file that can be used for further artistic applications or high-resolution prints.

_(Full code is available in `stippling_converter.py`)_

### Complex p5.js Artwork (March 2025)

The "Complex p5.js Artwork (March 2025)" project creates a visually pleasing and intricate artwork using multiple layers, colors, and movements. It generates a series of animated layers of circles that change over time, creating a mesmerizing and complex visual effect.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Layered Circular Patterns**: Multiple layers of circles, each with unique distortions and movements.
  - **Color Gradients**: Smooth transitions between colors to enhance visual appeal.
  - **Dynamic Animation**: Continuous animation that evolves over time, ensuring a constantly changing piece of art.
